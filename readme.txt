== ABOUT Blackpearls's Canvas ==

* the theme is made for the Piratenpartei Hamurg, http://www.piratenpartei-hamburg.de/
* the theme is based on the Scapegoat-Theme (https://github.com/zutrinken/scapegoat) by Peter Amende, http://peteramende.de/
* the default slider images and the 404 image are taken by Ben de Biel, http://www.bendebiel.com/

== HOW TO ==

* first of all, you have to insert some informations about yourself in your profile-section
* use custom menues and insert the start-page to the main-menu, if you want to display the home icon in your header menu
* use widgets for the sidebar and footer. The footer looks best with 4 Widgets with approximately equal heights. Don't use menu widgets in the footer, there is a separate footer-menu
* take a look at the theme-options and improve your front-page with it
* give your categories a description! You can use html-tags there as well and also images with caption. Insert your <img src=" + image url + " /> and <span class="meta-thumbnail-caption"> + caption + </span> at the Top of the Description. It will be cut by jQuery and append to the right place automatically.

== ISSUES ==

* rtl support
* optimize font-sizes in relation to the responsive behaviour
* custom frontpage-layout
* custom frontpage-"about me"-layout
